# Rust Cleaners

We are crafting some magic with Rust. The organisation name is a joke, because someone from HR wasn't aware that Rust is a programming language and gave us a candidate who mentioned cleaning the rust from aircrafts. Since then, we can't stop joking about it. It's quite funny, but lets talk about the serious stuff now.

## Who are we?

We are a team from a Research & Development department which works at [Fortune Electric] in Taipei å¤§å®‰, Taiwan, on-site.
