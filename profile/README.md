# Rust Cleaners

We are crafting some magic with Rust. The organisation name is a joke, because someone from HR wasn't aware that Rust is a programming language. He gave us a candidate who mentioned clearning the rust from the aircraft. Since then, we can't stop joking about it. Funny, haha. Okay, lets move on.

## Who are we?

We are a team from a Research & Development department which works at [Fortune Electric] in Taipei, Taiwan, on-site.
